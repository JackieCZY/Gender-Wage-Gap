# Gender-Wage-Gap
## Background
- This project is meant to find the factors that contribute to the gender wage gap in workplaces in the U.S

- This is the first project I did after I decided to select statistics as my second major

- Before doing this project, I was interested in learning women's rights and gender discrepencies.

## Summary

- Identified potential factors with 5 explanatory variables and 4 response variables and collected data from multiple open data bases 

- Performed 4 tests to analyze the significance of factors

## Abstract

This study intends to find the relationship between gender and income gaps in the United States. The data in the study is a subsampled merged dataset of multiple datasets from U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, OECD, U.S Department of Labor, and statistia. The merged dataset from the websites includes information of both female and male labors who once participated or still participating in the labor force in the U.S in the past 20 years. To be more specific, this study samples different number of cases in different tests, as the data is collected from combined datasets of several websites, and the population of these datasets may vary. But, the collected data from original datasets remains representativeness, and the data is used to analyze and infer the possible relationships within all the female and male full-time workers. Moreover, the relation between variables are test by four types of statistical test such as randomization test, t-test, chi-square test, and linear regression. The explanatory variables used in these tests are weekly working hours, major, occupation, age group, and educational level. The respons variables are employment rate, unemployment rate, income, and income level. Through the four different statistical tests, the hypothesis that gender affects income gaps is consistent with the result of the study. There exists an income gap between male and female full-time workers in different occupations. There are siginificant association between educational level and income level, with exception for the relations of employment rate and unemployment rate. Therefore, it is necessary to study gender as a factor contributes to income gaps in the United States.
